Column Name,Description,Example,Required
sample_id,Unique identifier for this specific data entry/row in the samplesheet.,LH00344_T_WES_1,Yes
patient_id,Identifier for the patient. This is the primary key used by Nextflow to group all data belonging to a single individual.,LH00344,Yes
assay,"Type of sequencing assay for FASTQ files specified in this row. Allowed values: WES, WGS, RNA. Case-insensitive.",WES,"Yes, if fastq_1 is provided. Optional otherwise."
status,"Sample status for FASTQ files specified in this row. Allowed values: tumor, normal. Case-insensitive.",tumor,"Yes, if fastq_1 is provided. Optional otherwise."
lane,"Lane or technical replicate identifier for FASTQ files (e.g., 1, 2). Used for grouping multiple FASTQ files before potential merging. If a sample has only one BAM/VCF, this can be left empty or set to 1.",1,Optional
fastq_1,"Absolute path to the forward reads FASTQ file (R1). If a BAM or VCF is provided for this data type (e.g., tumor DNA), this column can be left empty for that type.",/path/to/R1.fastq.gz,Optional
fastq_2,"Absolute path to the reverse reads FASTQ file (R2). Leave empty for single-end data. If a BAM or VCF is provided, this column can be left empty.",/path/to/R2.fastq.gz,Optional
bam,"Absolute path to a pre-existing BAM file. Type is determined by assay and status columns (e.g., assay=WES + status=tumor = tumor DNA BAM). If provided, FASTQ processing and alignment will be skipped for this sample.",/path/to/sample.bam,Optional
tumor_vcf_snv_indel,"Absolute path to a pre-existing tumor SNV/Indel VCF file. If provided, SNV/Indel calling will be skipped.",/path/to/tumor_snv_indel.vcf.gz,"Yes, if hla_alleles_str is provided and input_fasta is not provided. Optional otherwise."
input_fasta,"Absolute path to a custom protein FASTA file. This file should contain protein sequences (e.g., from novel ORFs, viral antigens) for direct epitope prediction. This is patient-level data and the path should be identical for all samples belonging to the same patient_id. If provided, it will trigger a separate prediction workflow (e.g., pVACbind).",/path/to/custom_proteins.fasta,"Yes, if hla_alleles_str is provided and tumor_vcf_snv_indel is not provided."
hla_alleles_str,"Directly provided HLA allele string (e.g., A*02:01,A*68:01;B*27:05,B*15:01;C*02:02,C*03:03). Use a semicolon (;) to separate loci and a comma (,) to separate alleles per locus. If provided, internal HLA typing will be skipped. Patient-level data - should be identical for all samples of the same patient_id.","A*02:01,A*68:01;B*27:05,B*15:01",Optional
tumor_vcf_sv,"Absolute path to a pre-existing tumor Structural Variant (SV) VCF file. If provided, SV calling from DNA will be skipped.",/path/to/tumor_sv.vcf.gz,Optional
tumor_vcf_cnv,"Absolute path to a pre-existing tumor Copy Number Variation (CNV) file (e.g., .cns from CNVkit, or other supported format). If provided, CNV calling from DNA will be skipped.",/path/to/tumor_cnv.cns,Optional
rna_fusion_calls,"Absolute path to a pre-existing RNA fusion calls file (e.g., fusions.tsv from Arriba, or star-fusion.fusion_predictions.tsv). If provided, RNA fusion calling will be skipped.",/path/to/fusions.tsv,Optional
intervals,"Absolute path to a target regions file (e.g., in BED or Picard interval_list format). This is crucial for targeted sequencing (like WES) to define the regions for analysis, especially for accurate CNV calling. For WGS, this can optionally be used to restrict analysis. This is patient-level data; the path should be the same for all DNA samples from the same patient.",/path/to/exome_targets.bed,Optional. Highly recommended for WES to ensure accurate CNV and variant calling.
cancer_type,"Identifier for the patient's cancer type, used to retrieve corresponding reference gene expression data (e.g., from a pre-compiled TCGA dataset) when patient-specific RNA-seq data is not available. The identifier must match those present in the reference expression file provided to the pipeline. This is patient-level data.",BRCA,"Yes, if patient RNA-seq data (via fastq_1 or bam with assay: RNA) is not provided for a patient and expression-based filtering is desired. Optional otherwise."
